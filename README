RPM/Make/Simple version 0.01
============================

RPM (RedHat Package Manager) is a way of rolling out files (such as binaries,
data etc.) in a nice, easily installable package.

RPM::Make::Simple is (hopefully) designed to provide a nice interface to the
RPM::Make Perl module for building these RPM's.

I'd recommend reading about RPM's, spec files and whatnot first, otherwise
the "Simple" bit will seem rather ironic. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   RPM::Make

Although most features will work with RPM::Make version 0.8, it is recommended
that you use 0.9 as bits and pieces (such as post installation scripts) will
not work. This can be found here:
